###### Period 8 SoftDev with Mr. DW

## Datasets:
- [Link one](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/english-word-frequency) this dataset counts the 333,333 most commonly-used single words on the English language web, as derived from the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus.
- [Link two](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html) - google’s ngram database available to download but tis huge.
- [Link three](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) top 10,000 most used words (minus naughty words)
- [Link four](https://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp?s=y) this dataset contains the top 60,000 words and associated genres (e.g. spoken or academic) as well as info on meaning and usage.

## Description/Relevance
This is relevant because language is the essential component for communication, someone that is possible more important now than ever (what with nuclear talks and all). Thus, it is equally important to understand this component and the effect of different words in different contexts as well as trends we see in word usage. A data visualization of English word use and frequency would help us learn more about the tool we use to do just about anything.

## How to make data come alive
We aim to make this data come alive by visualizing the word frequencies and comparing their usage. We can compare words with similar ones that have different connotations by having users select words and offering synonyms and their usage. This will possibly include line graphs featuring word usage over time (like google has) and maybe creating a random sentence based off of the probability of a word occuring at a certain part of a sentence. Or maybe just a random word generator that’s based off of its frequency in the English language.

## What will be shown, absent user interaction?
Absent user interaction, we will display default values and graphs. The introduction will be a paragraph explaining the meaning of the site and the data we are visualizing. Underneath will most likely be a chart with the most common words used. We could also add a super large-scope graph with the frequency of every word so that users can see what percentage of English words we really use and how often. We’ll also have pie charts with percentages of words like maybe how many are what part of speech or of a certain genre.

## What questions will your visualization allow user to explore? What questions will it provoke?
The user will be able to explore the aforementioned large-scope graph and zoom in on certain parts to see which words are the ones being used (or neglected). We will also let he or she type in different words to see how often they are being used.
